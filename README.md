# Stock-Market-Volatility-Prediction
The primary objective of this project is to model and predict stock market volatility by leveraging Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. Specifically, this approach aims to:

Identify Market Regimes using HMM

Use HMM to detect hidden states in stock market returns, such as low-volatility (bullish) and high-volatility (bearish) regimes.
Assign probabilities to each regime, helping traders and analysts understand market conditions.
Model Volatility Dynamics using GARCH

Use the GARCH model to capture the time-varying nature of volatility, accounting for clustering effects (i.e., volatility tends to persist over time).
Improve risk estimation by modeling how past volatility influences future market fluctuations.
Evaluate Model Performance

Assess how well the model predicts market volatility using error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Compare predicted volatility against actual returns to validate the effectiveness of the approach.
Visualize Market Volatility Trends

Plot stock returns and predicted volatility over time to gain insights into market trends and risk factors.
Provide a clear representation of different volatility regimes to aid decision-making.
